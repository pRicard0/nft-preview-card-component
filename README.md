# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U).

## My experience
The hardest part was creating the div overlay and styling it using CSS to get the effect that the challenge proposed. I confess that I had to do some research and ask ChatGPT. I hope that in future projects I don't need to look for help again.
This project is more difficult than others in the same category. It's a good project because I was able to learn a lot, including the hr tag that I didn't know yet.
